# Stellar

> "A bit of madness is key to give us new colors to see."

Stellar was inspired by a remarkable person — the kind you meet once and suddenly the world has more color in it. This app exists because some connections deserve to be explored, understood, and celebrated.

- RPG-style relationship quests with XP progression
- Daily transit outlook and compatibility timeline
